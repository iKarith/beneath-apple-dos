Data bits are recorded on the
diskette in precise intervals.  For
the purposes of this discussion, the
demarcation of these intervals will
be depicted by a clock bit.  Using
this representation, data written to
and read back from the diskette takes
the form shown in Figure 3.2.  The
data pattern shown represents a
binary value of 101.

program given there will read any

user to examine it or modify the data
and then, optionally, rewrite it to a

very important when learning about
diskette formats and when fixing
clobbered data.
