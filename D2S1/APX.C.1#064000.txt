.PP
ACCESS TIME]>The time required to
locate and read or write data on a
direct access storage device, such as
a diskette drive.
.pp
ADDRESS]>The numeric location of a
piece of data in memory.  Usually
given as a hexadecimal number from
$0000 to $FFFF (65535 decimal).  A
disk address is the location of a
data sector, expressed in terms of its
track and sector numbers.
.pp
ALGORITHM]>A sequence of steps which
may be performed by a program or
other process, which will produce a
given result.
.pp
ALPHANUMERIC]>An alphabetic character
(A-Z) or a numeric digit (0-9).  The
term used to refer to the class of all
characters and digits.
.pp
ANALOG]>As opposed to digital. 
Having a value which is continuous,
such as a voltage or electrical
resistance.
.pp
AND]>The logical process of
determining whether two bits are both
ones.  0 AND 1 results in 0 (false),
1 AND 1 results in 1 (true).
.pp
ARM]>The portion of a disk drive
which suspends the read/write head
over the disk's surface.  The arm can
be moved radially to allow access to
different tracks.
.pp
ASCII]>American Standard Code for
Information Interchange.  A
hexadecimal to character conversion
code assignment, such that the 256
possible values of a single byte may
each represent a alphabetic, numeric,
special, or control character.  ASCII
is used when interfacing to
peripherals, such as keyboards,
printers, or video text displays.
.pp
ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE]>Also known as
MACHINE LANGUAGE.  The native
programming language of the
individual computer.  Assembly
language is oriented to the machine,
and is not humanized, as is BASIC,
PASCAL, or FORTRAN.  An assembler is
used to convert assembly language
statements to an executable program.
.pp
BACKUP]>The process of making a copy
of a program or data against the
possibility of its accidental loss or
destruction.
.pp
BASE]>The number system in use. 
Decimal is base 10, since each digit
represents a power of 10
(1,10,100,...).  Hexadecimal is base
16 (1,16,256,...).  Binary is base 2
(1,2,4,8,...).
.pp
BINARY]>A number system based upon
powers of 2.  Only the digits 0 and 1
are used.  101 in binary, for
example, is 1 units digit, 0 twos,
and 1 fours, or 5 in decimal.
.pp
BIT]>A single binary digit (a 1 or a
0).  A bit is the smallest unit of
storage or information in a computer.
.PP
BIT CELL]>The space on a diskette,
between two clock pulses, which can

or 1 (bit).
.pp
BIT SLIP MARKS]>The epilogue of a
disk field.  Used to double check
that the disk head is still in read
sync and the sector has not been
damaged.
.pp
BOOT/BOOTSTRAP]>The process of
loading a very large program into
memory by loading successively larger
pieces, each of which loads its
successor.  The program loads itself
by "pulling itself up by its
bootstraps".
.pp
BRK]>BREAK.  An assembly langauge instruction
which can be used to force an
interrupt and immediate suspension of
execution of a program.
.pp
BUFFER]>An area of memory used to

transferred to or from a peripheral,
such as a disk drive.
.pp
BUG]>A programming error.  Faulty
operation of a program.

used
as an error indicator by many system
programs.
.PP
CATALOG]>A directory of the files on
a diskette.  See DIRECTORY.
.pp
CHAIN]>A linked list of data
elements.  Data is chained if its
elements need not be contiguous in
storage and
each element can be found from its
predecessor via an address pointer.
.pp
CHECKSUM/CRC]>A method for verifying
that data has not been damaged.  When
data is written, the sum of all its
constituent bytes is stored with it. 
If, when the data is later read, its
sum no longer matches the checksum,
it has been damaged.
.pp
CLOBBERED]>Damaged or destroyed.  A
clobbered sector is one which has
been overwritten such that it is
unrecoverable.  
.pp
CODE]>Executable instructions to the
computer, usually in machine
language.
.pp
COLDSTART]>A restart of a program
which reinitializes all of its
parameters, usually erasing any work
which was in progress at the time of
the restart.  A DOS coldstart erases
the BASIC program in memory.

CONTIGUOUS]>Physically next to.  Two
bytes are contiguous if they are
adjoining each other in memory or on
the disk.

the APPLE) is one micro-second or one
millionth of a second.
.pp
DATA]>Units of information.
.pp
DATA SECTOR BUFFER]>On the APPLE, a
256 byte buffer used by DOS to hold
the image of any given sector on the

from the file, data is extracted from
the data sector buffer until it is
exhausted, at which time it is
refilled with the next sector image.

examples of deferred commands.
.pp
DIGITAL]>As opposed to analog. 
Discrete values as opposed to
continuous ones.  Only digital values
may be stored in a computer.  Analog
measurements from the real world,
such as a voltage or the level of
light outside, must be converted into
a numerical value which, of
necessity, must be "rounded off" to a
discrete value.
.pp
DIRECT ACCESS]>Peripheral storage
allowing rapid access of any piece of
data, regardless of its placement on
the medium.  Magnetic tape is
generally not considered direct
access, since the entire tape must be
read to locate the last byte.  A
diskette is direct access, since the
arm may be rapidly moved to any
track and sector.
.pp
DIRECTORY]>A catalog of all files
stored on a diskette.  The directory
must contain each file's name and its
location on the disk as well as other
information regarding the type of

which places track formatting
information, including sectors and
gaps, on a blank diskette. 
During disk initialization, DOS also
places a VTOC and directory on the
newly formatted disk, as well as
saving the HELLO program.
.pp
DISPLACEMENT]>The distance from the
beginning of a block of data to a
particular byte or field. 
Displacements are usually given
beginning with 0, for the first byte,
1 for the second, etc.  Also known as

input stream to another program or an
output device.  A printer driver
accepts input from a user program in

bit bytes to 6 bit bytes for storage
on a DISK II.
.pp
ENTRY POINT (EPA)]>The entry point
address is the location within a
program where execution is to start. 
This is not necessarily the same as
the load point (or lowest memory
address in the program).
.pp
EOF]>End Of File.  This mark signals
the end of a data file.  $00 for
APPLE DOS text files.
.pp
EPILOGUE]>The last three bytes of a
field on a track.  These unique bytes
are used to insure the integrity of
the data which preceeds them.
.pp
EXCLUSIVE OR]>A logical operation
which compares two bits to determine
if they are different.  1 EOR 0
results in 1.  1 EOR 1 results in 0.

as a person's name, his age, or his
social security number.  In disk
formatting, a group of data bytes
surrounded by gaps.

sector buffer, a file manager
workarea buffer, the name of the
file, and pointers.  The DOS command,
MAXFILES 3, causes 3 of these file
buffers to be allocated.
.pp
FILE DESCRIPTOR]>A single entry in a
diskette directory which describes
one file.  Included are the name of
the file, its data type, its length,
and its location on the diskette.

which manages files.  The file
manager handles such general
operations as OPEN, CLOSE, READ,
WRITE, POSITION, RENAME, DELETE, etc.
.pp
FILE TYPE]>The type of data held by a
file.  Valid DOS file types are
Binary, Applesoft, Integer-BASIC,

based on powers of 16.  Valid hex
digits range from 0 to 9 and A to F,
where A is 10, B is 11, ... , and F
is 15.  B30 is 11 256's, 3 16's, and
0 1's, or 2864 in decimal.
Two hexadecimal digits can be used to
represent the contents of one byte.
Hexadecimal is used with computers
because it easily converts with
binary.

track to minimize access time due to
rotational delay.  Also called
"skewing" or interlacing.
