          Set the command index to -1 (none).
          Reset the pending command flag (none pending).
     9FD6 Add one to command index.
          If first charcater is a control-D, skip it.
          Flush to a non-blank (call A1A4).
          Compare command to command name in command name table
          at A884 for the current command index.
          If it doesn't match and if there are more entries
          left to check, go back to 9FD6.
          If it does match, go to A01B.
          Otherwise, if command was not found in the table, 
          check to see if the first character was a control-D.
          If so, go to A6C4 to print "SYNTAX ERROR".
          Otherwise, call A75B to reset the state and warmstart
          flag and go to 9F95 to echo the command and exit.
          (the command must be for BASIC, not DOS)
     A01B Compute an index into the operand table for the 
          command which was entered.
          Call A65E to see if a BASIC program is executing.
          If not, and the command is not a direct type command,
          (according to the operand table) go to A6D2 to print
          "NOT DIRECT COMMAND".
          Otherwise, if the command is RUN, make the prompt
          character ($33) non-printing.
          Check the operand table to see if a first filename
          is a legal operand for this command.
          If not, go to A0A0.
          Otherwise, clear the filename buffer (call A095).
          Flush to the next non-blank (call A1A4) and copy 
          the filename operand to the first filename buffer.
          Skip forward to a comma if one was not found yet.
          If a second filename is legal for this command, use
          the code above to copy it into the second filename
          buffer.
          Check both filenames to see if they are blank.
          If one was required by the command but not given,
          give a syntax error or pass it through to BASIC.
          (As in the case of LOAD with no operands)
          If all is well, go to A0D1 to continue.
     A095 A subroutine to blank both filename buffers.
     A0A0 Indicate no filename parsed.
          Check operand table to see if a positional operand
          is expected.
          If not, go to A0D1 to continue.
          Otherwise, call A1B9 to convert the numeric operand.
          If omitted, give syntax error.
          If number converted exceeds 16, give "RANGE ERROR"
          If number is supposed to be a slot number, give
          "RANGE ERROR" if it exceeds 7.
          If number is not a slot number, give "RANGE ERROR" if
          it is zero. (MAXFILES 0 is a no-no)
     A0D1 Set defaults for the keyword operands (V=0,L=0,B=0)
     A0E8 Get the line offset index and flush to the next
          non-blank, skipping any commas found.
          If we are not yet to the end of the line, go to A10C.
          Check to see if any keywords were given which were
          not allowed for this command.
          If not, go to A17A to process the command.
     A10C Lookup the keyword found on the command line in the
          table of valid keywords (A940)
          If not in table, give "SYNTAX ERROR" message.
          Get its bit position in the keywords-given flag.
          If the keyword does not have an operand value, go to
          A164.
          Otherwise, indicate keyword found in flag.
          Convert the numeric value associated with keyword.
          Give "SYNTAX ERROR" message if invalid.
          Check to see if the number is within the acceptable
          range as given in the keyword valid range table at
          A955.
          Save the value of the keyword in the keyword values
          table starting at AA66.
          Go parse the next keyword. go to A0E8.
     A164 Indicate C, I, or O keywords were parsed.
          Update the MON value in the keyword value table
          appropriately.
          Go parse the next keyword. go to A0E8.
