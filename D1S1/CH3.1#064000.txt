CHAPTER 3 - DISK II HARDWARE AND TRACK FORMATTING
.sp 2
.pp
Apple Computer's excellent manual on
the Disk Operating System (DOS)
provides only very basic information
about how diskettes are formatted. 
This chapter will explain in detail
how information is structured on a
diskette.  The first section will
contain a brief introduction to the
hardware, and may be skipped by those
already familiar with the DOS manual.
.pp
For system housekeeping, DOS divides
diskettes into tracks and sectors. 
This is done during the
initialization process.  A track is a
physically defined circular path
which is concentric with the hole in
the center of the diskette.  Each
track is identified by its distance
from the center of the disk.  Similar
to a phonograph stylus, the
read/write head of the disk drive may
be positioned over any given track. 
The tracks are similar to the grooves
in a record, but they are not
connected in a spiral.  Much like
playing a record, the diskette is
spun at a constant speed while the
data is read from or written to its
surface with the read/write head. 
Apple formats its diskettes into 35
tracks.  They are numbered from 0 to
34, track 0 being the outermost track
and track 34 the innermost.  Figure
3.1 illustrates the concept of
tracks, although they are invisible
to the eye on a real diskette.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.1 HERE ***
.pp
It should be pointed out, for the
sake of accuracy, that the disk arm
can position itself over 70 "phases".
To move the arm past one track to the
next, two phases of the stepper
motor, which moves the arm, must be
cycled.  This implies that data might
be stored on 70 tracks, rather than
35.  Unfortunately, the resolution of
the read/write head and the accuracy
of the stepper motor are such, that
attempts to use these phantom
"half" tracks create so much
cross-talk that data is lost or
overwritten.  Although the standard
DOS uses only even phases, some
protected disks use odd phases or
combinations of the two, provided
that no two tracks are closer than
two phases from one another.  See
APPENDIX B for more information on
protection schemes.
.bp
.pp
A sector is a subdivision of a track.
It is the smallest unit of
"updatable" data on the diskette. 
DOS generally reads or writes data a
sector at a time.  This is to avoid
using a large chunk of memory as a
buffer to read or write an entire
track.
Apple has used two different track
formats
to date.  One divides the track into
13 sectors, the other, 16 sectors.  The
sectoring does not use the index
hole, provided on most diskettes, to
locate the first sector of the track.
The implication is that
the software must be able
to locate any given track and sector
with no help from the hardware.  
This scheme, known as "soft sectoring",
takes a little more space
for storage but allows flexibility,
as evidenced by the recent change
from 13 sectors to 16 sectors per
track.  The following table
catagorizes the amount of data stored
on a diskette under both 13 and 16
sector formats.

TRACK FORMATTING
.pp
Up to this point we have broken down
the structure of data to the track
and sector level.  To better
understand how
data is stored and retrieved, we will
start at the bottom and work up.
.pp
As this manual is primarily concerned
with software, no attempt will be
made to deal with the specifics of
the hardware.  For example, while in
fact data is stored as a continuous
stream of analog signals, we will
deal with discrete digital data, i.e.
a 0 or a 1.  We recognize that the
hardware converts analog data to
digital data but how this is
accomplished is beyond the scope of
this manual.
.pp
Data is recorded on the diskette
using frequency modulation as the
recording mode.  Each data bit
recorded on the diskette has an
associated clock bit recorded with
it.  Data written on and read back
from the diskette takes the form
shown in Figure 3.2.  The data
pattern shown represents a binary
value of 101.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.2 HERE ***
.pp
As can be seen in Figure 3.3, the
clock bits and data bits (if present)
are interleaved.  The presence of a
data bit between two clock bits
represents a binary 1, the absence of
a data bit between two clock bits
represents a binary 0.  We will
define a "bit cell" as the period
between the leading edge of one clock
bit and the leading edge of the next
clock bit.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.3 HERE ***
.PP
A byte would consist of eight (8)
consecutive bit cells.  The most
significant bit cell is usually
referred to as bit cell 7 and the
least significant bit cell would be
bit cell 0.  When reference is made
to a specific data bit (i.e. data bit
5), it is with respect to the
corresponding bit cell (bit cell 5). 
Data is written and read serially,
one bit at a time.  Thus, during a
write operation, bit cell 7 of each
byte would be written first, with bit
cell 0 being written last. 
Correspondingly, when data is being
read back from the diskette, bit cell
7 is read first and bit cell 0 is
read last.  The diagram below
illustrates the relationship of the
bits within a byte.
.bp
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.4 HERE ***
.PP
To graphically show how bits are
stored and retrieved, we must take
certain liberties.  The diagrams are
a representation of what functionally
occurs within the disk drive.  For
the purposes of our presentation, the
hardware interface
to the diskette will be
represented as an eight bit "data latch".
While the hardware involves
considerably more complication, from a software
standpoint it is reasonable to use
the data latch, as it accurately
embodies the function of data flow to
and from the diskette.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.5 HERE ***
.pp
Figure 3.5 shows the three bits, 101,
being read from the diskette data
stream into the data latch.  Of
course another five bits would be
read to fill the latch.  As can be
seen, the data is separated from the
clock bits.  This task is done by the
hardware and is shown more for
accuracy than for its importance to
our discussion.
.pp
Writing data can be depicted in much
the same way (see Figure 3.6).
The clock bits which
were separated from the data must now
be interleaved with the data as it is
written.  It should be noted that,
while in write mode, zeros are being
brought into the data latch to
replace the data being written.  It
is the task of the software to make
sure that the latch is loaded and
instructed to write in 32
cycle intervals.  If not, zero bits
will continue to be written every four
cycles, which is, in fact, exactly
how self-sync bytes are created. 
Self-sync bytes will be covered in
detail shortly.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.6 HERE ***
.PP
A "field" is made up of a group of 
consecutive
bytes.  The number of bytes varies,
depending upon the nature of the
field.  The two types of fields
present on a diskette are the Address
Field and the Data Field.  They are 
similar in that they both contain a
prologue, a data area, a checksum, and
an epilogue.  Each field on a track is
separated from adjacent fields by a
number of bytes.  These areas of
separation are called "gaps" and are
provided for two reasons.  One, they
allow the updating of one field
without affecting adjacent fields (on
the Apple, only data fields are
updated).  Secondly, they allow the
computer time
to decode the address field before
the corresponding data field can pass
beneath the read/write head.
.pp
All gaps are primarily alike in
content, consisting of self-sync
hexadecimal FF's, and vary only in
the number of bytes they contain. 
Figure 3.7 is a diagram of a portion
of a typical track, broken into its
major components.
.bp
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.7 HERE ***
.PP
Self-sync or auto-sync bytes are
special bytes that make up the three
different types of gaps on a track. 
They are so named because of their
ability to automatically bring the
hardware into synchronization with
data bytes on the disk.  The
difficulty in doing this lies in the
fact that the hardware reads bits and
the data must be stored as eight bit
bytes.  It has been mentioned that a
track is literally a continuous
stream of data bits.  In fact, at the
bit level, there is no way to
determine where a byte starts or
ends, because each bit cell is
exactly the same, written in precise
intervals with its neighbors.  When
the drive is instructed to read data,
it will start wherever it happens to
be on a particular track.  That could
be anywhere among the 50,000 or so
bits on a track.  Distinguishing
clock bits from data bits,
the hardware finds
the first bit cell with data in it
and proceeds to read the following
seven data 
bits into the eight bit latch.  In
effect, it assumes that it had
started at the beginning of a data
byte.  Of course, in reality, the
odds of its having started at the
beginning of a byte are only one in
eight.  
Pictured in Figure 3.8 is a small
portion of a track.  The clock bits
have been stripped out and 0's and
1's have been used for clarity.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.8 HERE ***
.pp
There is no way from looking at the
data to tell what bytes are
represented, because we don't know
where to start.  This is exactly the
problem that self-sync bytes
overcome.
.pp
A self-sync byte is defined to be a
hexadecimal FF with a special
difference.  It is, in fact, a 10 bit
byte rather than an eight bit byte.  Its
two extra bits are zeros.  Figure 3.9
shows the difference between a normal
data hex FF that might be found
elsewhere on the disk and a self-sync
hex FF byte.
.bp
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.9 HERE ***
.pp
A self-sync is generated by using a
40 cycle (micro-second) loop while
writing an FF.  A bit is written
every four cycles, so two of the zero bits
brought into the data latch while the
FF was being written are also
written to the disk, making the 10
bit byte. (DOS 3.2.1 and earlier versions use
a nine bit byte due to the hardware's
inability to always detect two
consecutive zero bits.)  It can be
shown, using Figure 3.10, that five
self-sync bytes are sufficient to
guarantee that the hardware is
reading valid data.  The reason for
this is that the hardware requires
the first bit of a byte to be a 1.
Pictured at the top of the figure is
a stream of five auto-sync bytes.  Each
row below that demonstates what the
hardware will read should it start
reading at any given bit in the
first byte.  In each case, by the
time the five sync bytes have passed
beneath the read/write head, the
hardware will be "synched" to read the
data bytes that follow.  As long as
the disk is left in read mode, it
will continue to correctly interpret
the data unless there is an error on
the track.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.10 ***
.PP
We can now discuss the particular
portions of a track in detail.  The
three gaps will be covered first. 
Unlike some other disk formats, the
size of the three gap types will vary
from drive to drive and even from
track to track.  During the
initialization process, DOS will
start with large gaps and keep making
them smaller until an entire track
can be written without overlapping
itself.  A minimum of five self-sync
bytes must be maintained for
each gap type (as discussed earlier).
The result is fairly uniform gap
sizes within each particular track.
.pp
Gap 1 is the first data written to a
track during initialization.  Its
purpose is twofold.  The gap
originally consists of 128 bytes of
self-sync, a large enough area to
insure that all portions of a track
will contain data.  Since the speed
of a particular drive may vary, the
total length of the track in bytes is
uncertain, and the percentage
occupied by data is unknown.  The
initialization process is set up,
however, so that even on drives of
differing speeds, the last data field
written will overlap Gap 1, providing
continuity over the entire physical
track.  Care is taken to make sure
the remaining portion of Gap 1 is at
as long as a typical Gap 3
(in practice its length
is usually more than 40),
enabling it to serve
as a Gap 3 type for Address Field
number 0 (See Figure 3.7 for
clarity).
.bp
.pp
Gap 2 appears after each Address
Field and before each Data Field. 
Its length varies from five to ten bytes
on a normal drive.  The primary
purpose of Gap 2 is to provide time
for the information in an Address
Field to be decoded by the computer
before a read or write takes place. 
If the gap were too short, the
beginning of the Data Field might
spin past while DOS was still
determining if this was the
sector to be read.  The 240 odd
cycles that six self-sync bytes provide
seems ample time to decode an address
field.  When a Data Field is written
there is no guarantee that the write
will occur in exactly the same spot
each time.  This is due to the fact
that the drive which is rewriting
the Data Field may not be the one
which originally INITed or wrote it. 
Since the speed of the drives can
vary, it is possible that the write
could start in mid-byte. (See Figure
3.11)  This is not
a problem as long as the difference
in positioning is not great.  To
insure the integrity of Gap 2, when
writing a data field, five self-sync
bytes are written prior to writing
the Data Field itself.  This serves
two purposes.  Since relatively
little time is spent decoding an
address field, the five bytes help place
the Data Field near its original
position.  Secondly, and more
importantly, the five self-sync bytes
are the minimum number required to
guarantee read-synchronization.  It
is probable that, in writing a Data
Field, at least one sync byte will be
destroyed.  This is because, just as
in reading bits on the track, the
write may not begin on a byte
boundary, thus altering an existing
byte.  Figure 3.12 illustrates this.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.11 HERE ***
.SP1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.12 HERE ***
.PP
Gap 3 appears after each
Data Field and before each Address
Field.  It is longer than Gap 2 and
generally ranges from 14 to 24 bytes
in length.  It is quite similar in
purpose to Gap 2.  Gap 3 allows the
additional time needed to manipulate
the data that has been read before
the next sector is to be read.  The
length of Gap 3 is not as critical as
that of Gap 2.  If the 
following Address
Field is missed, DOS can always wait
for the next time it spins around
under the read/write head, at most
one revolution of the disk.  Since
Address Fields are never rewritten,
there is no problem with this gap
providing synchronization, since only
the first part of the gap can be
overwritten or damaged. (See Figure
3.11 for clarity)
.bp
.pp
An examination of the contents of the
two types of fields is in order.
The Address Field contains
the "address" or identifying
information about the Data Field 
which follows it.  The volume, track,
and sector number of any given sector
can be thought of as its "address",
much like a country, city, and street
number might identify a house.  As
shown previously in Figure 3.7, there
are a number of components which make
up the Address Field.  A more
detailed illustration is given in
Figure 3.13.
.sp1
*** INSERT FIGURE 3.13 HERE ***
.PP
The prologue consists of three bytes
which form a unique sequence, found
in no other component of the track. 
This fact enables DOS to locate an
Address Field with almost no
possibility of error.  The three
bytes are $D5, $AA, and $96.  The $D5
and $AA are reserved (never written
as data) thus insuring the uniqueness
of the prologue.  The $96, following
this unique string, indicates that
the data following constitutes an
Address Field (as opposed to a Data
Field).  The address information
follows next, consisting of the
volume, track, and sector number and
a checksum.  This information is
absolutely essential for DOS to know
where it is positioned on a
particular diskette.  The checksum is
computed by exclusive-ORing the first
three pieces of information, and is
used to verify its integrity. 
Lastly follows the epilogue, which
contains the three bytes $DE, $AA and
$EB.  Oddly, the $EB is always written
during initialization but is never
verified when an Address Field is
read.  The epilogue bytes are
sometimes referred to as "bit-slip
marks", which provide added assurance
that the drive is still in sync with
the bytes on the disk.  These bytes
are probably unnecessary, but do
provide a means of double checking.
.pp
The other field type is the Data
Field.  Much like the Address Field,
it consists of a prologue, data,
checksum, and an epilogue. (Refer to
Figure 3.14)  The prologue is
different only in the third byte. 
The bytes are $D5, $AA, and $AD,
which again form a unique sequence,
enabling DOS to locate the beginning
of the sector data.  The data
consists of 342 bytes of encoded
data.  The encoding scheme used will
be discussed in the next section. 
The data is followed by a checksum
byte, used to verify the integrity of
the data just read.  The epilogue
portion of the Data Field is
absolutely identical to the epilogue
in the Address Field and it serves
the same function.
